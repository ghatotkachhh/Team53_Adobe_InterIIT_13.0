## **Notebooks Overview**

### 1. **`exp_inference_groupwise.ipynb`**
This notebook focuses on **group-wise artifact classification and explanation**. It provides a structured pipeline for analyzing images by categorizing artifacts into predefined groups and generating explanations for each detected group.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Artifact Categories**: The notebook evaluates artifacts across six primary groups:
  - AI Defects
  - Biological Defects
  - Overprocessing
  - Reality Breaks
  - Scene Oddities
  - Texture Defects
- **Classification and Explanation**:
  - Detects relevant artifact categories in input images.
  - Generates localized, context-specific explanations for artifacts in each group.
- **Inference Time**:
  - ~230 seconds per image

### 2. **`task-2-inference.ipynb`**
This notebook emphasizes **artifact detection and detailed explanation at the individual artifact level**, leveraging a comprehensive list of the 70 predefined artifact types.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Artifact Detection**:
  - Detects specific artifact types such as inconsistent object boundaries, texture anomalies, and lighting inconsistencies.
- **Explanation Generation**:
  - Produces concise, context-specific explanations when artifacts are detected.
- **Visualization**:
  - Annotates analyzed images with detected artifacts and their evaluations.
- **Inference Time**:
  - ~78 seconds per image  

#### **Applications**:
- Forensic image analysis for detecting unnatural features.
- Detailed image dataset validation.
