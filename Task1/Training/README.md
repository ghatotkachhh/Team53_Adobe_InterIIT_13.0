#  **Training for AI Generated Image Detection- Adobe MidPrep InterIIT 13.0**
##  **Datasets**
1. CIFAKE - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/cifake-real-and-ai-generated-synthetic-images
2. Artifact - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyanshrastogi44/artifacts-cleaned
3. Genimage - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yangsangtai/tiny-genimage

All models take 32x32 images as input and classify each as REAL or FAKE

## **DenseNet-121**
*Initialize*: Model, optimizer, and data loaders.

*Training Loop*:
1. Train the model on batches.
2. Validate the model after each epoch.
3. Log metrics and update training history.

*Early Stopping*: Stops training when validation performance no longer improves.

*Final Evaluation*: Returns validation metrics and the complete training history.

*Metrics Summary*
1. Loss: Average loss across the dataset.
2. Accuracy: Ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.
3. Precision: Focuses on minimizing false positives.
4. Recall: Focuses on minimizing false negatives.
5. F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
6. Confusion Matrix: Provides detailed insight into prediction errors.

##  **VIT tiny**
*Dataset Preparation:*
1. Input images are processed into batches using the custom collate_fn.
2. Ground truth labels are also batched.

*Collate Function:*
The collate_fn function processes batches of examples into a suitable format for training:
1. pixel_values: Stacks image tensors into a batch tensor using torch.stack().
2. labels: Converts labels into a PyTorch tensor.
3. Returns: A dictionary with keys pixel_values (image data) and labels (ground-truth labels).
This ensures that batches are created with uniform tensor shapes during training and evaluation.

*Metrics:*
1. Accuracy Metric:
The accuracy metric is loaded using the evaluate library.
2. compute_metrics Function:
Extracts predictions and labels from the evaluation output.
Calculates predicted class labels by taking the argmax of the prediction logits.
Computes accuracy using the evaluate library and returns it in a dictionary.

##  **PatchCraft**
*Patch Processing:*
1. Use normal_patches to split an image into patches.
2. Compute texture diversity of patches using texture_diversity.
3. Reconstruct rich and poor texture images with smash_reconstruction.

*High-Pass Filtering:*
1. Apply high-pass filtering with high_pass.
2. Combine filtered results using concat_high_pass.
3. Visualize the results with plot_images.

*Training Phase:*
1. Residual and Classifier in Training Mode: residual.train() and classifier.train() ensure that layers like Dropout and BatchNorm behave correctly during training.

2. Batch Processing:
Rich and poor texture inputs (rich and poor) and labels are moved to the device (e.g., GPU).
residual_output: Combines features from rich and poor using the Residual model.
predictions: Generated by passing the residual output through the Classifier.

3. Loss is computed with loss_fn(predictions, labels) and accumulated.

4. Accuracy is updated using accuracy_metric.update(predictions, labels).

5. Backward Pass and Optimization:
Backpropagation: loss.backward() computes gradients.
Optimizer step: optimizer.step() updates the weights.
Gradient reset: optimizer.zero_grad() clears gradients to prevent accumulation.
Learning Rate Adjustment
Scheduler Step: scheduler.step() updates the learning rate based on the current epoch.

*Validation Phase*
1. Residual and Classifier in Evaluation Mode: residual.eval() and classifier.eval() disable training-specific layers like Dropout.
2. No Gradient Computation: torch.no_grad() ensures that gradients are not computed, reducing memory usage and speeding up evaluation.
3. Accuracy Metric:
accuracy_metric.reset(): Resets the metric at the start of validation.
accuracy_metric.update(predictions, labels): Updates accuracy with batch predictions.
Final validation accuracy is computed with accuracy_metric.compute().item().
